# ALU-Project
This github repository describes about the 1 -Bit, 4-Bit Logic Unit (ALU) using Circuit Verse.

Introduction to the ALU:-  
  •	ALU stands for Arithmetic Logic Unit. <br />
  •	It is a combinational digital circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations.<br />
  •	It’s an important component of computer’s Central Processing Unit (CPU).<br />
  •	In this Project, it performs Addition, Subtraction, NAND and NOR operations.<br />

Function:-  
•	It can perform any simple arithmetic operations (add, sub etc..) and logical operation such (And, OR) etc.  
•	Depending on the ‘OP’  selected, the result to be shown at the ‘OUT’.  
•	It stands as an Integrated Circuit (IC) (74181). It also can be synthesized using VHDL.
