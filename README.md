# ALU-Project
This github repository describes about the 1 -Bit, 4-Bit Logic Unit (ALU) using Circuit Verse.

Introduction to the ALU:-  
  *	ALU stands for Arithmetic Logic Unit. <br />
  *	It is a combinational digital circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations.<br />
  * The flow of bits and the operations performed on them in the subunits of the ALU are controlled by gated circuits.
  *	It’s an important component of computer’s Central Processing Unit (CPU).<br />
  *	In this Project, it performs Addition, Subtraction, NAND and NOR operations.<br />

Function:-  
*	It can perform any simple arithmetic operations (add, sub etc..) and logical operation such (And, OR) etc.  
*	Depending on the ‘OP’  selected, the result to be shown at the ‘OUT’.  
*	It stands as an Integrated Circuit (IC) (74181). It also can be synthesized using VHDL.  

A Basic ALU supports these common logic operations.
 Arithmatic Operation:-
* ALU accepts the inputs in binary format and performs the Add (with carry), Sub (with Borrow), Two's complement etc.
* The inputs are summed, subtracted or performed the required operations and show up the output in the "OUT."
* in the two's complement, an input is subtracted from the zero and the output appears in "OUT."

 Bitwise Logical Operation:-
*  AND- the bitwise operation of AND appears in the "OUT."
*  and so on. it can show up to any logic function such as, OR, XOR, XNOR, NAND, NOR etc.

Advantage:-
* It supports parallel architecture and applications with high performance.
* It has the capability of performing instructions on a very large set and has a high range of accuracy.
